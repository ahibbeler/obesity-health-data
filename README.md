# Adult Obesity Data
## Acknowledgements
This data repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
* It contains the raw data set and the subset that was created from the raw data which was accomplished by manipulating the data using Python3.
* It also contains the Google Colaboratory Python notebook that has instructions on how the subset was created from the raw data.

# Diving into the Repository
## What the does the repository provide?
* This data set provides information about adult obesity in North Carolina, and its correlation to health rates in North Carolina. 
* Additional factors related to adult obesity are included in the raw data for any further data analysis of adult health.
* This data can be used by health specialists or individuals who are curious about adult obesity and factors with causation and correlation. 

## What is the purpose of this repository? 
The purpose of this obesity data is to show the correlation between adult obesity and poor health in North Carolina. The finalized data in the ```CompiledDataFinal.csv``` can be used to analyze the correlation between these factors. The ```CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv``` can be used to analyze other factors in relation to adult obesity such as physical inactivity levels to further examine this aspect of citizen life in North Carolina. 

## How can users get started with the repository?
* Downloading the ```CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv``` file is necessary to replicate the processes used in this repository. This file can be found at the top of the repository, and the hyperlink can be found in the Accessing the Data section of this README file.
* After your file has been downloaded, import that data into any program that runs Python. (This project utilizes Google Colaboratory, and directions for the processes that were used can be found in the Google Colab notebook that is linked at the top of the repository as a .ipynb file.)
* Finally, make sure that the Pandas package is imported into the Python notebook you are using (directions can be found in the .ipynb file linked at the top of the repository).
